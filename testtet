NaN:NaN:NaN: made no mention of the proposed Bank of. 3.879s
NaN:NaN:NaN: England which is only described or one. 5.081s
NaN:NaN:NaN: might say secreted 2third down in the. 4.841s

NaN:NaN:NaN: was that they were needed in order to. 3.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: fund the interest on all future. 3.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: government loans shortly thereafter. 3.84s

NaN:NaN:NaN: although the Coalition forces were. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: defeated at Jana on the 14th of October. 5s

NaN:NaN:NaN: for the next 9 years in order to protect. 4.4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: France and her new economic dispensation. 4.68s

NaN:NaN:NaN: join Napoleon&#39;s Continental blockade. 3.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: England and to provide each other with. 3.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: mutual support in the event of disputes. 3.839s
NaN:NaN:NaN: with other nations and in particular the. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: British Empire at that time France and. 3.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Russia were the only two countries in. 3.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Europe which were not on the Usery. 3.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: system and were furthermore not indebted. 3.8s
NaN:NaN:NaN: to the Rothschilds they were therefore. 4.52s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the only free and independent nations. 4.44s
NaN:NaN:NaN: however a few years later Russia started. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: to violate the blockade this action was. 3.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: premised on the fact that Russia a. 3.959s
NaN:NaN:NaN: producer of mainly raw materials had. 4.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: very little industrial capacity and had. 3.321s
NaN:NaN:NaN: been dependent on England for the. 3.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: importation of Industrial Products. 3.879s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Alexander was only prepared to continue. 3.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: with the blockade subject to France. 3.961s
NaN:NaN:NaN: supplying him with the industrial goods. 3.439s
NaN:NaN:NaN: which he had previously imported from. 3.52s
NaN:NaN:NaN: England France could not supply these. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Goods as England commanded the Seas and. 3.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: there was no Road or rail infrastructure. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in Europe at that time therefore in. 4.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: order to enforce the blockade Napoleon. 4.281s
NaN:NaN:NaN: decided to invade Russia on the 24th of. 5.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: June 1812 with an army of over 500,000. 5.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: soldiers although he reached Moscow on. 4.881s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the 14th of September 1812 he found that. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: it had been abandoned and the subsequent. 3.28s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Winter retreat turned into a major. 4.08s
NaN:NaN:NaN: disaster with only 110,000 of his. 4.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: original army surviving the following. 3.639s

NaN:NaN:NaN: the British island of St Helena in the. 3.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: South Atlantic where he died under. 3.48s
NaN:NaN:NaN: suspicious circumstances when he was. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: still a fit man at the age of 51 on the. 4.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: 5th of May 1821 an examination of. 4.559s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Napoleon&#39;s remains has indicated that he. 3.641s

NaN:NaN:NaN: poisoning following chronic arsenic. 4.439s
NaN:NaN:NaN: intox in such a case it would. 3.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: undoubtedly have been the work of a. 3.601s

NaN:NaN:NaN: against that busy body that Holy monk of. 4.321s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the financial Empire and showed him the. 3.92s

NaN:NaN:NaN: deception when he came to the presidency. 4.08s
NaN:NaN:NaN: he had certain qualities of mind and. 3.641s
NaN:NaN:NaN: heart which entitled him to a high place. 3.679s

NaN:NaN:NaN: was one thing he was not and which he. 4.361s
NaN:NaN:NaN: never aspired to be he was not a banker. 4.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: he said that he knew very little about. 4.44s

NaN:NaN:NaN: warned against the dangers that might. 3.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: ensue if the predatory interests after. 4.16s

NaN:NaN:NaN: Disguise and unite themselves to the. 3.679s
NaN:NaN:NaN: executive and through him acquire. 3.6s
NaN:NaN:NaN: control of the government that is what. 3.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the predatory interests did when they. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: came back in the liary of hypocrisy and. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: under false pretenses obtained the. 4.279s
NaN:NaN:NaN: passage of the Federal Reserve Act the. 3.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: danger that the country was warned. 3.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: against Came Upon upon us and is shown. 3.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in the long train of Horrors attendant. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: upon the Affairs of the traitorous and. 3.961s

NaN:NaN:NaN: Federal Reserve Banks look around you. 3.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: when you leave this chamber and you will. 4.199s
NaN:NaN:NaN: see evidences of it on all sides this is. 5.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: an era of economic misery and for the. 4.281s
NaN:NaN:NaN: conditions that cause that Misery the. 3.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Federal Reserve board and the federal. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: reserve banks are fully liable this is. 4.52s
NaN:NaN:NaN: an era of financed crime and in the. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: financing of crime the Federal Reserve. 3.44s
NaN:NaN:NaN: board does not play the part of a. 3.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: disinterested spectator the people of. 3.6s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the United states are being greatly. 3.56s
NaN:NaN:NaN: wronged if they are not then I do not. 4.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: know what wronging the people means they. 4.119s
NaN:NaN:NaN: have been driven from their Employments. 3.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: they have been dispossessed of their. 3.08s

NaN:NaN:NaN: corporations so far as the people of the. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: United States are concerned the cupboard. 4.121s
NaN:NaN:NaN: is bare it is true that the warehouses. 4.079s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and coal yards and grain elevators are. 3.879s
NaN:NaN:NaN: full but the warehouses and coal yards. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and grain elevators are padlocked and. 3.56s

NaN:NaN:NaN: their property has been taken from them. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: without due process of law Mr chairman. 4.52s
NaN:NaN:NaN: common decency requires us to examine. 3.721s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the Public Accounts of the government to. 3.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: see what crimes against the public. 4.4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: welfare have been or are being committed. 4.721s
NaN:NaN:NaN: what is needed here is a return to the. 3.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Constitution of the United States we. 3.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: need to have complete divorce of bank. 4.281s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and state the old struggle that was. 4.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: fought out here in Jackson&#39;s day must be. 4.44s
NaN:NaN:NaN: fought over again the independent United. 4.44s
NaN:NaN:NaN: States Treasury should be reestablished. 3.439s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and the government should keep its own. 3.279s

NaN:NaN:NaN: the people provided for that purpose. 3.761s
NaN:NaN:NaN: asset currency the device of the. 3.52s

NaN:NaN:NaN: United States currency on it the. 3.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: business of the independent Bankers. 3.28s

NaN:NaN:NaN: coercion the Federal Reserve District. 3.6s
NaN:NaN:NaN: should be abolished and state boundaries. 3.6s
NaN:NaN:NaN: should be respected Bank Reserves should. 3.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: be kept within the borders of the states. 3.48s
NaN:NaN:NaN: who people own them and this Reserve. 3.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: money of the people should be protected. 3.6s

NaN:NaN:NaN: acceptance bankers and discount dealers. 4.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: cannot draw away from them the exchanges. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: should be closed while we are putting. 3.201s
NaN:NaN:NaN: our financial affairs in order the. 3.201s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Federal Reserve Act and the Federal. 3.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Reserve Banks having violated their. 3.239s

NaN:NaN:NaN: of office should be impeached and. 3.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: brought to trial unless this is done by. 4.321s
NaN:NaN:NaN: us I predict that the American people. 5.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: outraged mobbed pillaged insulted Ed and. 5.439s
NaN:NaN:NaN: betrayed as they are in their own land. 3.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: will rise in their wrath and send a. 3.561s
NaN:NaN:NaN: president here who will sweep the money. 4.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: changers out of the temple from the. 4.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: above speech it may be noted that the. 3.679s
NaN:NaN:NaN: concerns raised by the labor party in. 3.521s
NaN:NaN:NaN: South Africa during the debate on the. 3.641s
NaN:NaN:NaN: South African Banking and currency bill. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: that what had been done in the USA was. 3.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: not in the interests of the public but. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of the banks were fully Justified that. 4.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the naive and foolish legislators of. 4.319s
NaN:NaN:NaN: 1920 allowed the South African Reserve. 4.239s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Bank to be established as a replication. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of the US Federal Reserve bank which. 4.08s
NaN:NaN:NaN: congressman mcfaden described as being. 3.801s
NaN:NaN:NaN: one of the most corrupt and evil. 3.84s
NaN:NaN:NaN: institutions in the world is a matter of. 4.279s
NaN:NaN:NaN: deep regret and must be censured in the. 5.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: strongest terms Clifford Hugh Douglas. 6.361s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Clifford Hugh Douglas 1879 to 1952 was. 5.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: an engineer who while working as. 3.639s
NaN:NaN:NaN: assistant superintendent at the Royal. 3.799s
NaN:NaN:NaN: aircraft Factory in farmor England. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: during World War I noticed that the. 3.84s
NaN:NaN:NaN: total cost of goods were greater than. 4.281s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the sums paid in lie of wages salaries. 4.601s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and dividends he decided to investigate. 3.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: this disc connect in the way money. 3.319s
NaN:NaN:NaN: flowed through industry and after. 3.441s
NaN:NaN:NaN: collecting data from hundreds of. 3s
NaN:NaN:NaN: companies found that there was a. 3.399s
NaN:NaN:NaN: persistent deficit in purchasing power. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of consumers relative to Total costs of. 4.561s
NaN:NaN:NaN: production he considered income tax to. 4.481s
NaN:NaN:NaN: be a negative dividend and instead. 3.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: proposed the payment of a national. 3.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: dividend to all citizens which would. 3.241s
NaN:NaN:NaN: bridge the gap between earnings and. 3.399s
NaN:NaN:NaN: prices this dividend would provide. 3.4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: consumers with the additional buying. 3.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: power necessary to absorb all the. 3.279s
NaN:NaN:NaN: current production of goods in a. 3.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: non-inflationary manner this forms part. 5.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of Douglas&#39;s a plus b Theory fizzed that. 4.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: prices are always being generated at a. 4.241s
NaN:NaN:NaN: faster rate than incomes are produced so. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: that the total prices of all Goods in. 3.719s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the economy at any particular stage. 3.481s
NaN:NaN:NaN: exceed the total buying power of. 3.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: consumers Douglas&#39;s economic theory. 4.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: known as social credit advocated the. 3.761s
NaN:NaN:NaN: transfer of the money creation process. 3.56s
NaN:NaN:NaN: from private Banks which create money. 3.479s
NaN:NaN:NaN: out of nothing as an interest bearing. 4.479s
NaN:NaN:NaN: debt to a State Bank he also proposed a. 4.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: price adjustment mechanism called the. 4.561s
NaN:NaN:NaN: just price this mechanism would reduce. 4.521s
NaN:NaN:NaN: prices by a percentage as a consequence. 4.08s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of physical efficiencies introduced into. 3.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the production process through. 3.359s
NaN:NaN:NaN: improvements in technology in this. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: manner the benefits of Technology would. 3.601s
NaN:NaN:NaN: flow directly to the workers and. 3.399s
NaN:NaN:NaN: increase their standard of living. 3.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Douglas was very aware of the fact that. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: these increasing technological advances. 3.361s
NaN:NaN:NaN: would make the attainment of Full. 3.681s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Employment and impossibility hence his. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: insistence on the payment of a national. 3.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: dividend which was calculated by adding. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: to a basic income the increase in. 4.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: national production and consumption data. 4.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: after World War I Douglas devoted the. 3.599s
NaN:NaN:NaN: rest of his life to the promotion of his. 3.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: ideas and gave lectures in many. 3.8s
NaN:NaN:NaN: countries including Australia Canada. 4.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Japan New Zealand and Norway he achieved. 5.2s
NaN:NaN:NaN: two notable successes one the social. 4.239s
NaN:NaN:NaN: credit party obtained control of the. 3.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: provincial government of Alberta Canada. 4.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in 1935 two after a lecture tour in. 5.721s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Japan in 1929 his policies were adopted. 5.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: by the Japanese government in 1932. 4.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Douglas&#39;s policies were very much feared. 4.361s
NaN:NaN:NaN: by the international bankers and in the. 4.519s
NaN:NaN:NaN: 1930s they put up a very considerable. 4.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: sum of5 million pounds in order to. 3.881s
NaN:NaN:NaN: counter his high highly successful. 3.679s
NaN:NaN:NaN: program of public Enlightenment Douglas. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: had nothing but disdain for Central. 3.721s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Banking and on one occasion while. 4.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: delivering a speech in newcal upon time. 5.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in 1937 he described the bank of England. 5.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: as being a mental institution Irving. 6.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Norton Fischer Irving Fischer 1867 to. 6.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: 1947 was a famous Professor of Economics. 4.639s
NaN:NaN:NaN: at yel University who adopted a. 3.601s
NaN:NaN:NaN: mathematical approach to resolving. 3.841s
NaN:NaN:NaN: economic problems he is well known for. 4.359s
NaN:NaN:NaN: his utility Theory which ju toose the. 4.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: measurability of the utility function to. 4.321s
NaN:NaN:NaN: demand theory in his Treatise the theory. 4.401s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of Interest he observed the changes in. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the value of goods relative to changes. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in time in interest rates this later. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: became known as the quantity theory of. 3.8s
NaN:NaN:NaN: money throughout his life he was active. 4.92s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in the Eugenics movement in March 1913. 5.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Senator Robert L Owen chairman of the. 3.639s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Senate Banking Committee tried to. 3.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: introduce an alternative Bill to the. 3.841s
NaN:NaN:NaN: fraudulent Rothchild Rockefeller banking. 4.359s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in currency proposal the bill would have. 3.8s
NaN:NaN:NaN: allowed for the inclusion of staple. 3.681s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Commodities as part of the monetary base. 3.8s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in in addition to Gold and Silver and. 3.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: would thereby have prevented the. 3.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: possibility of either inflation or. 3.48s
NaN:NaN:NaN: deflation and would have created true. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: freedom of employment Irving fiser. 3.679s
NaN:NaN:NaN: assisted Owen in the drafting of this. 3.36s
NaN:NaN:NaN: bill but was subsequently blackmailed. 3.641s
NaN:NaN:NaN: into withdrawing his support the. 3.4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: following Illuminating paragraph. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: extracted from Emanuel josephson&#39;s the. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Federal Reserve conspiracy and. 4s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Rockefeller their gold Corner describes. 4.44s
NaN:NaN:NaN: what transpired the conspirators. 3.96s
NaN:NaN:NaN: determined to block the adoption of the. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Owen bill they had Professor fiser. 4.32s
NaN:NaN:NaN: summoned before the Yale officials and. 3.6s
NaN:NaN:NaN: conf fronted with the charge that he was. 4.159s
NaN:NaN:NaN: so foolish as to Advocate money based on. 4.559s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Commodities other than gold he was. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: warned related Senator Owen that there. 4.161s
NaN:NaN:NaN: would be no place at Yale or in any. 5.361s
NaN:NaN:NaN: other university for anyone so foolish. 5.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: Professor Fischer was keenly aware of. 4.08s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the side on which his bread was buttered. 4.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and was no more principled unfortunately. 4.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: than are the multitude of professors. 3.88s
NaN:NaN:NaN: prostituted to the conspirators and. 3.56s

NaN:NaN:NaN: this paper we were able rigorously to. 4s

NaN:NaN:NaN: carefully calibrated model of the. 3.76s

NaN:NaN:NaN: this ability to generate and live with. 3.92s

NaN:NaN:NaN: loan activities after hearing the first. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: lecture delivered by fader the idea. 3.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: immediately came into my head that I had. 3.72s
NaN:NaN:NaN: found a way to one of the most essential. 3.799s
NaN:NaN:NaN: prerequisites for the founding of a new. 4.52s
NaN:NaN:NaN: party to my mind fader&#39;s Merit consisted. 4.681s
NaN:NaN:NaN: in the ruthless and trenchant way in. 3.68s
NaN:NaN:NaN: which he describes the double character. 3.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: of the capital engaged in stock exchange. 4.24s
NaN:NaN:NaN: and Loan transaction s laying be the. 4.08s

NaN:NaN:NaN: not deny alant that his ideas were sound. 4.64s
NaN:NaN:NaN: but they doubted whether it&#39; be possible. 4.12s
NaN:NaN:NaN: to put these ideas into practice to me. 3.76s
NaN:NaN:NaN: this seemed the strongest point in. 2.759s
NaN:NaN:NaN: fader&#39;s teaching though others. 4.16s
NaN:NaN:NaN: considered it a weak point and again I. 4.441s
NaN:NaN:NaN: understood immediately that here was a. 3.56s
NaN:NaN:NaN: truth of transcendental importance for. 3.639s
NaN:NaN:NaN: the future of the German people the. 3.759s
NaN:NaN:NaN: absolute separation of Stock Exchange. 3.721s

NaN:NaN:NaN: attacking Capital as such for to do this. 4.04s
NaN:NaN:NaN: would be to jeopardize the foundations. 3.84s
